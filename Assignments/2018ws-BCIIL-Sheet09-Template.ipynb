    " * For all figures that you generate, remember to add meaningful labels to the axes (including units), and provide a legend and colorbar, if applicable.\n",
    " * Do not hard code constants, like number of samples, number of channels, etc in your program. These values should always be determined from the given data. This way, you can easily use the code to analyse other data sets.\n",
    " * Do not use high-level functions from toolboxes like scikit-learn.\n",
    " * Before submitting, check your code by executing: Kernel -> Restart & run all.\n",
    " * Replace *Template* by your *FirstnameLastname* in the filename, or by *Lastname1Lastname2* if you work in pairs."

Calculate this corresponding ratio of variance as trial averages: Apply all 51 CSP filters to the data and calculate the variance in each trial.

Calculate the ratio of the average variance in class 1 divided by the sum of the average variances in both classes. Visualize the result in a plot like the Eigenvalues. \n",
